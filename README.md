# go-kafka-sample - simple kafka consumer and producer

This small demo project just demos a simple Kafka consumer and producer messaging scenario.
A consumer group listener polling for messages from a topic while a producer is sending events.
In the end the application is just very basic and has no ambition to demo a full production ready implementation,
but rather a basic starting point to get into Go and Kafka
